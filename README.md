# 🎵 Album-Tracker

Album-Tracker helps you keep track of all the music you promise you will "get around to one day"!

## 🤔Why do I need to keep track of my music?

If you want to listen to more songs on a daily basis than there is time in the day, you need to keep track of the old and the new. This tool lets you maintain a digital shelf to all the albums you have heard and all the ones you want to hear!

## 🎤 I want to know how close I am to finshing my favorite artist's discography!

No worries! You can actively check the percentage of an artists discography you have listened to so far, and when its all done, they will appear in your completed artists tab!

## 🎸What if I am wondering what songs are on the album I want to start listening to?

Album-Tracker uses the [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API) to get you the best matching tracklist for all albums in your list!

## 🥁This seems like a lot of maintenence, won't this be time consuming to keep track of?

All you need to manually input is what albums you would like to listen to. The default tracker already comes equipped with lots of popular artists amongst many genres, but feel free to add anything you want!

## 🎹 What kind of automations does it have?

The tracker will actively track the percentage of albums you have listened to based on the checks to amount of albums there are. By default, it is set to update the list at midnight. When updating, it will sort all albums top to bottom from newest to latest release date, place a "to be released" line for future albums, reset the daily progress boxes, keep a counter of how many albums are celebrating their anniversary today, and update your completed artists list!
